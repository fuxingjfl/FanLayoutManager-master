## Welcome to Fan Layout Manager for Android by Cleveroad

Fan Layout Manager is a new library created at Cleveroad. Our ideas don’t come from nowhere, everything we invent results from the difficulties we overcome. This exactly what happened — we were fighting uniformity! Since traditional view of the simple horizontal list isn’t impressive anymore, we decided to suggest our vision adding some colours and a completely new motion path.

#####Check out the animation <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0r37_tXeMc">Fan Layout Manager for Android on YouTube</a></strong> in HD quality.

Cleveroad gladly shares its creation with everyone who wants to add some visual spice to their Android apps. Take Fan Layout Manager and create!

Using Fan Layout Manager you can implement the horizontal list, the items of which move like fan blades (in a circular way of a radius to your choice). To give a slightly chaotical effect to the motion, it’s possible to set an angle for the list items. So, every implementation of the library can be unique.

### Installation ###
by Gradle:
```groovy
    compile 'com.cleveroad:fan-layout-manager:1.0.5'
```
### Setup and usage ###
Use default FanLayoutManager in code:
```JAVA
fanLayoutManager = new FanLayoutManager(getContext());
recyclerView.setLayoutManager(fanLayoutManager);
```

You can **select/deselect** item using:
```JAVA
fanLayoutManager.switchItem(recyclerView, itemPosition); // select/deselect
fanLayoutManager.deselectItem();                         // just deselect
```

**Get selected item position**:
```JAVA
fanLayoutManager.getSelectedItemPosition(); // return selected item position
fanLayoutManager.isItemSelected();          // true if item was selected
```

To customize ***FanLayoutManager*** we provide settings:
```JAVA
FanLayoutManagerSettings fanLayoutManagerSettings = FanLayoutManagerSettings
                .newBuilder(getContext())
                .withFanRadius(true)
                .withAngleItemBounce(5)
                .withViewWidthDp(120)
                .withViewHeightDp(160)               
                .build();

fanLayoutManager = new FanLayoutManager(getContext(), fanLayoutManagerSettings);
recyclerView.setLayoutManager(fanLayoutManager);
```

`.withFanRadius(boolean isFanRadiusEnable)`   - you can enable displaying items in fan style.</p>
`.withAngleItemBounce(float angleItemBounce)` - added rendom bounce angle to items from [0.. angleItemBounce).</p>
`.withViewWidthDp(float viewWidthDp)`         - custom item width. default 120dp.</p>
`.withViewHeightDp(float viewHeightDp)`       - custom item height. default 160dp.</p>

You can *remove bounce angle* effect for selected item:
```JAVA
public void straightenSelectedItem(Animator.AnimatorListener listener);
```
and you can *restore bounce angle* effect for selected item:
```JAVA
public void restoreBaseRotationSelectedItem(Animator.AnimatorListener listener)
```

You can collapse views using:
```JAVA
public void collapseViews();
```
